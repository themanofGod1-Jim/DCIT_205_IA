    <!-- <h1> WELCOME</h1>
    <p>

        This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is
        therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and
        make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for
        our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods
        used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of
        Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept
        programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering principles
        to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.

        The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find
        employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working
        in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to
        that team. The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established
        and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.

        The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major
        (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
